% Comptue takeoff lift coefficient (assumes Clmax is 1.2 times the takeoff lift coefficient 
  Cl_to   = inputs.AeroInputs.Clmax/1.44; 
 
% Compute takeoff parrameter (based on Raymer Ch.5 Figure 5.4)
  takeoff_parameter = (inputs.PerformanceInputs.WS)/(Cl_to*inputs.PerformanceInputs.PW);
  
% Estimate takeoff distance by using takeoff_parameter and Figure 5.4 in Raymer Ch.5 
  output.Sto = takeoff_parameter*8.5; % take-off distance; 8.5 is the slope for Ground Roll for a propeller aircraft;
                                      % change to meet FAR part 23
                                      % requirements
