%% Function that computes the fuel and takeoff weight for different economic missions
% The approach is similar to the aircraft sizing routine, but with the
% exception that the empty weight of the aircraft is fixed (already known)
% The economic mission is assumed to be:
%
%              ______cruise_____
%             /                 \ descend
%            /                   \___
%           /climb                \_/ loiter
%          /                        \ 
%_________/                          \_____ 
%taxi & TO                          landing & taxi
%
% Additional mission segments can be added but this function must be
% changed to accomodate these.
