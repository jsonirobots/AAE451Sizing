%This function estimates the empty of the aircraft, following the same     % 
%approach used in the excel "simple" and "initial" sizing sheets.          %
%Recommended to perform an empty weight build-up by estimating the weight  % 
% of all the aircraft component (groups).                                  %
% See Raymer Ch.15 Eq. 15.25 - 15.45 for alternative ways to compute       %
